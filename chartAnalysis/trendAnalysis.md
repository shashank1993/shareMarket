What is the trend? 
Trend represent the direction a market is moving.
Problem: No market moves in a straight line.


Three type of trends:

1. Uptrend:
An uptrend is most often rep- resented by a series of rising peaks (highs) and troughs (lows). As long as each succeeding peak is higher than the prior peak, and as long as each successive trough is higher than the preceding trough, the uptrend remains intact.
Warning: Failure to exceed previous high - early warning of trend reversal.


2.

3. Sideways: Sideways movements are often nothing more than a pause in the exist- ing trend, after which the prior trend resumes. At other times, a sideways movement can signal an important reversal of the trend in progress.

When a trend is in motion, when it is likely to continue, and when it is likely to reverse.





Why trend analysis?
Dont want to caught in long term market stillness.
