1. Draw trendline long term and short term
2. If it is following the up trend in long term for 5 years then search for opportunity in short term - trendline and fibonacci retracement
3. If it is not following trend check the sign of resistance and support and if it is downtrend and reversing.
   if it is uptrend then continuation trend. correlate with volume trend.
   
   
-- if long term is positive then in small term buy when going up till long term is negative.
