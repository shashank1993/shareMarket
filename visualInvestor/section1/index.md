Steps:

1. Draw trendline long term and short term or the rising peaks and toughs.
2. If it is following the up trend in long term for 5 years then search for opportunity in short term - trendline and fibonacci retracement
    * if it is only retracement not only reverse pattern then buy and sale when reverse pattern happens.
3. If it is not following trend check the sign of resistance and support and if it is downtrend and reversing.
   if it is uptrend then continuation trend. correlate with volume trend.
   
   
-- if long term is positive then in small term buy when going up till long term is negative.


Trendline:

1. NIFTY IT

2. GOLDSHARE
    * 4399 was earlier a strong resistance now a strong support.
    If it moves to 4600 it will be trend reversal from bearish to bullish or if it breaks 4399 decisively down then it will be bearish trend.  



* if long term positive
  - if short term positive then wait for below trendline to buy. 
  - if short term retracement not pattern then buy at retracement. sell at inversion pattern or more than 62% inversion.
  - if short term correction then wait for inversion pattern
  
* if long term negative
   - wait for inversion on long chart.
